# Will It Meow

Will It Meow allows you to submit your images to an AI that will test the meow potential of them.

It's built with Vite-React-Typescript and Python-Flask on for the API.

This is meant to be a fun project with nice code behind. Any recomendations/critiques are well received :).

## How to run

Just run `docker compose up` and test it on port 5173.
